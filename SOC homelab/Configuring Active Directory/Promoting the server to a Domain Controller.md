# Summary
- This section involves the promotion of the Windows Server 2019 into a Domain Controller (DC).

# Promoting the server to a Domain Controller
- Prior to the installation of Active Directory Domain Services (AD-DS), I assigned the server a static IP and DNS IP adresses.
- To do this, I navigated to the network adapter's settings on the machine.

- I also changed the NIC of the vm to have the custom made VNET I made previously

- Using the **ping** command, I can now verify that the server's connectivity is isolated.

- To be able to promote the server, AD-DS has to be installed.
- This was done by the addition of roles and features.

- We can now see that the installation of AD-DS was successful.

- Next, I added a new forest to serve as the domain in the lab.
