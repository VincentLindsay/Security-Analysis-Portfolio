# Overview
This section revolves around the deployment of two different Ubuntu servers that are used for Splunk, and Wazuh.

# Retrieving the ISO
- I obtained the Ubuntu servers from Ubuntu's download page.
- Direct link: https://ubuntu.com/download/server
- For this lab, I used Ubuntu server version 24.04.4.
- To obtain a previous version, navigate to the alternative downloads page on the server downloads.

- Once downloaded, I proceeded to install, and configure both servers.

# Setting up Splunk Server
- Once I configured the VM to the settings I wanted, I began to configure it in VMware.

- I also installed the OpenSSH server so I can use my host terminal to SSH into the server for easier configuration.
- Once logged in, I used the **ip -a** command to obtain the IP address

- I also updated the packages, and created a snapshot of the fresh install prior to installing Splunk.

# Setting up Wazuh Server
- Similarly, I configured the Wazuh server to be similar to the Splunk machine.

- I also installed the OpenSSH server much like the Splunk server.
