# Overview
This section involves the installation and configuration of a Windows 10 endpoint to serve as the victim machine in a later simulated attack.

# Steps taken
- To retrieve the ISO for Windows 10, I searched the web for "download windows 10".
- Direct link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
- I used to media creation tool to create the ISO file

- When I reached the choice of what to have the media tool do, I selected the option of creating an installation media
- Then have the tool create the ISO file
  


- After sometime, I created the virtual machine, and disabled side channel mitigations for additional performance.
- I will eventually add Splunk Universal Forwarder, and Sysmon to this vm.
- I will also add this machine to the domain I created.

- Since I do not have a product key, I chose the option of "I don't have a product key."
- I selected Windows 10 Pro as the edition of Windows for this homelab.
- After sometime, the vm reached the set up phase of Windows.

- I chose the "Set Up for Work or School" option because I can create a local account, and Domain join later.

- For the name of the user account, I named it my name: Vincent.
- Once logged in, I began to optimise the performance of the vm, and I disabled Windows Updates via group policy edit.

- Now the Windows machine is in a good state to configure Sysmon, and Splunk universal forwarder.
