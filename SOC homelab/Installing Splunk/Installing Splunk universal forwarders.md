# Installing Splunk universal forwarder (Windows 10 Endpoint)
- To begin, I started with the installation of Splunk Universal Forwarders (UF) on the Windows 10 Endpoint.
- To verify connectivity, I pinged the Splunk Server from the Windows endpoint.

- To see a detailed account of how I installed the UF, check out my splunk [lab](https://github.com/VincentLindsay/Security-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Splunk%20lab/Setting%20Up%20Forwarder.md)

- A major difference between the original Splunk lab is the IP address of the Splunk server.

# Installing Splunk universal forwarder (Domain Controller)
- To be able to install the UF on the Domain Controller (DC), I have to install a different browser than internet explorer.

- I disabled the security zones in order to be able to access any website, and in this case install the UF.
- As a result, I downloaded chrome in order to be to access splunk[.]com
- Now I can proceed with installing the universal forwarder.

- To simplify the identification of the host while doing Splunk searches, I changed the name of the DC.

- Once the UF was installed, I added these configurations
- In Splunk, I can now see the DC, with the proper configurations I made.

- I also installed sysmon to the DC.

# Installing Splunk universal forwarder (Suricata Server)
- To install the UF on the Suricata server, I utilized wget to obtain the UF installer.

- Next, I began to install the Splunk forwarder by installing the packages.

- I had the UF point towards the Splunk server.
- I also added the configurations necessary to forward the  Suricata logs.

- After restarting the service, the universal forwarder restarted without any issue.
