# Overview
This section involves the development of the virtual machines used in this lab, the machines used will be an Ubuntu server (ver. 24.04.4), and a Windows 10 pro VM.

# Booting up Windows machine
* To build the Windows 10 vm, I acquired a Windows 10 ISO file
* By visiting the download Windows 10 page, I downloaded the media creation tool
* link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
* Once I downloaded the media creation tool, I selected the option to create an installation media

* Since I may use the ISO file for other virtual machines, I unselected the option to use the recommended options for my PC

* Once downloaded, I began to create the virtual machine in VMware

* I also chose the custom Windows installation option
* I followed all of the options, and created a generic user account

* Without any issues, I was able to install Windows, and I also installed VMware tools.
* I also created a snapshot of the VM

# Creating Ubuntu server
* For the Ubuntu server, I searched google for ubuntu server, and found the Get Ubuntu page
* link: https://ubuntu.com/download/server
* Currently, the latest version of Ubuntu server is 26.04, however I chose version 24.04.4 in the previous downloads page

* After some time, the ISO downloaded to my PC
* Once downloaded, I began to configure the settings for the vm
<img width="513" height="475" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b24f77-63d6-4bc7-90cc-3d0aff90f331" />

* These are the settings I used based off my current specs of my host machine.
* Once booted, I followed the installation pages in the VM
* I did install OpenSSH to give myself the ability to SSH into the server via my host machine if needed.

* Once the server was installed, I SSH'd into the server via Powershell

* I updated and upgraded the packages
* After the updates finished, I created a snapshot of the fresh ubuntu installation.
* Now that the machines are installed and configured, I can now proceed with installing splunk onto the server.
